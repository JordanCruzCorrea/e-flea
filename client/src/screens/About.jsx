        <h2>Why E•FLEA?</h2>
        <p>The market has been yearning for a medium where the sellers can communicate directly with each other without being tracked. Set your own terms, keep all your conversations in your own personal e-mail record. We don't log your location, the items you clicked on, etc- we only store what you give us until you delete it. Just create your item, fill out the required fields, sit back, and wait for people to come to your virtual spot on E•FLEA. 
        </p>

        <h3>Terms and conditions</h3>
        <p>E•FLEA, its creators, its hosting companies, and/or anybody other than you and ONLY YOU will take absolutely zero responsibility for any liability or occurence that may arise out of your use of this platform. It's entirely up to you to facilitate the sale however you see fit, and to whom you see fit. Please don't make any illegal listings. We're trying to run a legitimate site for free. Don't ruin it for the rest of us. Thanks. </p>
